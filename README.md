# **30 Days of Verilog**

> *A personal challenge to learn, build, and document digital design using Verilog.*

---

### ⚙️ Overview

Welcome to **30 Days of Verilog** — my hands-on journey through the world of **digital design and Verilog HDL**.  
The goal is simple: build **30 digital circuits in 30 days**, understand how they work, and share what I learn.

I didn’t post daily updates here, while this repository serves as the complete technical record of the work.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Master Verilog** — Build a solid foundation in hardware description and logic design.  
- **Explore Digital Circuits** — Implement and simulate a wide range of classic designs.  
- **Document the Journey** — Record the process, challenges, and insights from each build.  
- **Give Back** — Share examples others can learn from or build upon.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each day’s work is organized into a folder: **Day 1** to **Day 30**, containing:

- **Verilog Code** — The design files (`.v`) and testbenches.  
- **README** — A short explanation of the circuit, purpose, and logic.  
- **Simulations** — Waveforms and test outputs (if applicable).  
- **Reflections** — Notes, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

This project is about more than code — it’s about consistency, curiosity, and craftsmanship.  
Each circuit reflects a step toward mastering digital logic, one Verilog module at a time.
